#AStarPathfinding
#Instructions:
1. Select a square to be the source of the path. This will be one endpoint of the square.
2. Select a square that will be the destination of the path. This will be the second endpoint of the path.
3. Select any number of obstacle squares. These squares will be marked in blue and will be inaccessible to the algorithm.
4. Once the desired number of obstacle squares have been selected, press find path and a path will be generated between the source square and the destination square.
